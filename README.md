# Backup of my Sublime packages and settings.
Pull/clone/download and put into the Sublime user folder. If PackageControl is installed it should set up everything for you. You might get some errors from the Ayu theme, but it should be simple enough to fix.


## WIP
+ Add personal settings from Sublime itself. Mainly colorschemes and some minor tweaks that are Sublime spesific, not user spesific.
  - At the moment i need to find a way to sync the changes done text, comments and background for the Monokai default theme. Currently im using the Ayu theme, with a slightly modified Monokai color scheme instead of the default Ayu scheme.
+ The process could be automated with a script, atleast for Linux installations, not sure if il bother with a Windows solution. Need a way for PackageControl to automatically download the Ayu theme.
